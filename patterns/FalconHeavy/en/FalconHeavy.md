## Terminology

I use abreviates in the pattern here are them to help you read the pattern

* Rnd : Round
* sc : Single crochet

* inc : Increase
* dec : Decrease

For each round you'll find the number of the round, the instructions and the total number of stiches between parenthesis

## Supplies

* 1 crochet size 4
* 1 white ball of yarn
* 1 black gray ball of yarn

For the wool I use the Salsa of the Cheval blanc brand and Prym crochets
